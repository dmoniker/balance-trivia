# TriviaBalance

A balance approach to trivia games, testing your knowledge across various categories while improving your balance.

## Description

Balance Trivia improves balance over time. The game is two minutes long and can be played daily to improve your balance and your trivia knowledge.

## Features

- Feature 1: Two levels of balance exercises (single-leg and tandem)
- Feature 2: Answer as many trivia questions as you can in two minutes
- Feature 3: Switch legs every wrong answer

## Technologies Used

- This uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Trivia answers come from the local .js file, and can be supplemented with additional questions as desired. There are hundreds of questions, which are randomly presented to the player.
- Enhancements include tracking answers to avoid showing repetitions across sessions, and adding more questions.

## Usage

The game is self-explanatory
